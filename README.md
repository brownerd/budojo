# BUDOJO

A little repo for running js/css in the browser without all the boilerplate setup

1. clone the repo
1. run `npm i`
1. run `npm start`
1. Goto `http://localhost:9966/` in a browser
1. Edit the `index.js` file, save it and watch it update in the browser


## More info
So, I just want to write some JS in a file and see the output in the browser. I can do that with this little setup. I no longer need to create an html file with all the fixings just to prototype some js.

I used to use CodeRunner, but that only gives me console output. I like this becuase I can also output to the browser window too. And I can do liveReloading.
